# TST Notepad

A Firefox addon answering to a very niche group.
Adds a minimal note-taking application to the subpanel in Tree Style Tabs, to allow for taking notes on the side while having open a document or article.

### Features:
- Fuzzy searching (using Levenshtein algorithm)
- Local storage saving
- Rich Text Capability (Bold, italic, headdings, lists...)
- Autosave
- Light/Dark theme 
- Note preview before opening
- Neat css tricks

Note: must contain local file of the libraries used because when in the panel cannot make network calls (might move to background page later)
